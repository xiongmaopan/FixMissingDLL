    id: 'what-does-dll-missing-mean',
    question: 'What does it mean when a DLL is missing?',
    answer: `When Windows displays a "DLL is missing" error, it means the operating system or an application cannot find a Dynamic Link Library file that it needs to run. DLLs contain code, data, and resources that multiple programs can use simultaneously. Common causes include:
    
• The DLL file was accidentally deleted or moved
• A program uninstallation removed a shared DLL
• Malware infection corrupted or deleted the file
• Windows system files are corrupted
• The application installation was incomplete`,

  {
    id: 'what-is-dll-error',
    question: 'What is a DLL error?',
    answer: `A DLL error occurs when Windows cannot load or find a Dynamic Link Library file required by a program. DLL errors typically appear as pop-up messages with text like:

• "The program can't start because [filename].dll is missing"
• "The code execution cannot proceed because [filename].dll was not found"
• "[filename].dll is either not designed to run on Windows or contains an error"

These errors prevent applications from launching or cause them to crash during use.`,

  },
  {
    id: 'what-does-dll-stand-for',
    question: 'What does .DLL stand for?',
    answer: `**DLL stands for Dynamic Link Library.**

A DLL is a file format used in Windows that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. Key characteristics:

- **Dynamic** - Loaded into memory only when needed
- **Link** - Programs link to the DLL's functions at runtime
- **Library** - Contains reusable code, functions, and resources

**Benefits of DLLs:**
- Reduce memory usage by sharing code
- Enable modular software design
- Allow updates without recompiling applications
- Facilitate plugin architectures`,
    relatedGuides: []
  },
  {
    id: 'what-is-purpose-of-dll',
    question: 'What is the purpose of a DLL file?',
    answer: `DLL files serve several important purposes in Windows:

1. **Code Sharing** - Multiple programs can use the same DLL, saving disk space and memory

2. **Modular Design** - Programs can be built from separate components that are easier to update

3. **Resource Efficiency** - DLLs are loaded only when needed, reducing startup time

4. **Easy Updates** - Update a single DLL to fix bugs in all programs that use it

5. **Plugin Support** - Many applications use DLLs to add features via plugins

**Examples:**
- kernel32.dll - Core Windows functions
- msvcp140.dll - C++ runtime functions
- d3d11.dll - DirectX 11 graphics`,
    relatedGuides: []
  },
  {
    id: 'what-program-opens-dll',
    question: 'What program opens a DLL file?',
    answer: `DLL files are not meant to be "opened" like documents. However, you can view their contents with:

**For General Users:**
- DLLs are automatically loaded by programs that need them
- You don't need to manually open DLL files

**For Developers/Advanced Users:**
- **Visual Studio** - Debug and analyze DLLs
- **Dependency Walker** - View DLL dependencies
- **PE Explorer** - Examine DLL structure
- **7-Zip** - Extract resources from DLLs
- **Resource Hacker** - View/edit embedded resources

**Note:** Simply double-clicking a DLL won't open it in a useful way.`,
    relatedGuides: []
  },
  {
    id: 'is-it-okay-to-delete-dll',
    question: 'Is it okay to delete DLL files?',
    answer: `**Generally, NO - do not delete DLL files**, especially:

❌ **Never delete:**
- System DLLs in C:\\Windows\\System32
- DLLs in program installation folders
- Any DLL you don't fully understand

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Programs depending on that DLL will stop working
